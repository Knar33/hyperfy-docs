# SDK Overview

If you've ever used [React](https://reactjs.org) to build a website or app, you'll feel right at home building your own dynamic and interactive virtual world on Hyperfy.

Hyperfy is built using React from the ground up using our own custom react reconciler. You won't see any `<div>`'s around here because we've swapped that all out for metaverse primitives such as `<model>` and `<trigger>`.

You can build practically anything but here are a few ideas:

- A simple hangout, home or gallery
- An interactive game or puzzle
- A live event venue
- An exclusive club with secret areas
- A crypto-enabled store or an entire mall
- A CMS with changeable layouts and features
